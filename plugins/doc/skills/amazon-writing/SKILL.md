# Amazon Writing Standards

Amazon has a distinctive "no PowerPoint" culture that emphasizes narrative memos and clear, data-driven communication. This skill provides guidelines for rewriting content following Amazon's internal writing standards.

## Core Writing Rules

Apply these six principles to all Amazon-style documents:

### 1. Narrative Structure

Write in complete narrative form with logical flow from beginning to middle to end. No bullet points or slide-style formatting. The document tells a complete story where all information connects logically. Each paragraph builds on the previous one, leading to a coherent and persuasive argument.

### 2. Conciseness and Clarity

Use simple, straightforward language. Avoid jargon and acronyms unless spelled out on first use. Keep sentences under 30 words when possible. If specialized terms are necessary, provide brief explanations. The reader should understand the topic without needing supporting documents.

### 3. Data Over Adjectives

Replace vague qualifiers with specific, quantifiable data and metrics:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "significantly increased" | "increased 47%" |
| "many customers" | "1,247 customers" or "73% of customers" |
| "very fast" | "completes in 2.3 seconds" |
| "substantial savings" | "$2.4M annual savings" |
| "recently" | "on March 15, 2024" |

Every claim requires evidence, not assumptions.

### 4. Active Voice

Write in active voice for clearer, more concise, and more confident text:

| Passive (Avoid) | Active (Use) |
|-----------------|--------------|
| "The feature was developed by the team" | "The team developed the feature" |
| "Customers were surveyed" | "We surveyed customers" |
| "The decision was made" | "Leadership decided" |

### 5. The "So What" Test

Every sentence must add value and have a clear purpose. The reader should immediately understand why each piece of information matters. If a sentence doesn't pass the "so what" test, remove it or rewrite it to show relevance.

### 6. Respect the Reader's Time

Present the most important information clearly and early. Eliminate "clutter" words that don't add meaning. Executives should immediately understand why they should care within the first page.

## Document Types

Amazon uses four primary document formats. Load the appropriate reference file based on document type:

| Document Type | When to Use | Reference File |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Press Release | New product/feature announcements | `references/press-release.md` |
| 6-Pager | Complex strategic topics, detailed analysis | `references/six-pager.md` |
| 1-Pager | Straightforward topics, quick decisions | `references/one-pager.md` |
| PRFAQ | Product innovation, working backwards | `references/prfaq.md` |

## Rewriting Process

When rewriting content to Amazon style:

### Step 1: Analyze Content

Use a scratchpad to analyze before rewriting:

1. Identify the main message or purpose
2. Note vague adjectives/adverbs that need specific data
3. Find passive voice constructions to convert
4. Flag jargon or acronyms needing clarification
5. Determine the logical narrative flow
6. For specific document types: identify required sections present or missing

### Step 2: Load Document Guidelines

Read the appropriate reference file for the target document type to understand required sections and format.

### Step 3: Rewrite

Transform the content following:
- Core writing rules (narrative, data-driven, active voice)
- Document-specific structure and sections
- Length constraints for the document type

### Step 4: Verify

Check the rewritten content against:
- All six core writing rules applied
- Required sections present for document type
- No bullet points (narrative prose only)
- Specific metrics replace vague qualifiers
- Active voice throughout
- Appropriate length for document type

## Quality Standards

A well-written Amazon document demonstrates:

- **Mastery**: Deep understanding of every aspect of the topic
- **Realism**: Optimistic but honest assessment, not rose-colored
- **Data-based**: Firm grasp of metrics and evidence
- **Risk awareness**: Clear understanding of challenges and conditions for success/failure

The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues for improvement, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind.

## Reference Files

For detailed document-specific guidelines:

- **`references/press-release.md`** - Press release format and sections
- **`references/six-pager.md`** - 6-pager memo structure
- **`references/one-pager.md`** - 1-pager memo format
- **`references/prfaq.md`** - PRFAQ structure with FAQ guidelines
