# Press Release Format

A press release announces a new product or feature from the customer's perspective. Maximum length: 1 to 1.5 pages.

## Required Sections

### 1. Heading

Create a catchy, simple product name that customers immediately understand. No technical jargon or internal codenames.

### 2. Sub-Heading

Write a single sentence describing:
- The target customer
- The primary benefit they receive

### 3. Summary Paragraph

Provide a concise summary effective enough that if the reader stops here, they understand the key points. This paragraph must stand alone as a complete overview.

### 4. Problem Paragraph

Describe the customer problem from the customer's point of view. Use customer language, not technical terms. Make the pain point vivid and relatable. Include specific data about the problem's scope or impact.

### 5. Solution Paragraph(s)

Detail how the product solves the problem:
- What the product does
- How it addresses the specific pain points
- What makes it different from alternatives
- Key features that deliver the benefit

### 6. Spokesperson Quote

Include a quote from a company spokesperson that:
- Expresses excitement about the product
- Reinforces the customer benefit
- Adds credibility and human element

### 7. Customer Quote

Include a hypothetical customer quote that:
- Describes their experience with the product
- Highlights specific benefits they received
- Uses natural, conversational language
- Includes specific results if possible

### 8. How to Get Started

Explain how easy it is to begin using the product:
- Simple steps to get started
- What the customer needs to do
- Timeline for seeing results

### 9. Call to Action

Direct readers where to go for more information:
- Website URL
- Sign-up instructions
- Contact information

## Writing Guidelines

### "Oprah-speak" (No Geek-Speak)

Use language simple enough for a general audience. Imagine explaining the product on a talk show:
- No acronyms without explanation
- No technical specifications unless essential
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Use everyday words

### Length Constraint

Keep the press release to one page, maximum one and a half pages. Every word must earn its place. If content exceeds this limit, cut the least essential information.

### Tone

- Enthusiastic but credible
- Customer-focused, not company-focused
- Specific and concrete
- Forward-looking and positive
