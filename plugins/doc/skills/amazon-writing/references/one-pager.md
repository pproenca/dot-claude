# 1-Pager Memo Format

The 1-pager is a condensed narrative document for straightforward topics requiring quick decisions. It captures the essence of a longer document by summarizing information and highlighting important points.

## When to Use

Use a 1-pager when:
- The topic is relatively straightforward
- Only a few key points need to be understood
- Executive leadership needs a quick overview
- Decisions can be made with limited context
- Time constraints prevent full 6-pager development

Use a 6-pager instead when:
- Complex issues require detailed analysis
- Multiple data points need examination
- Technical teams need comprehensive information
- Strategic decisions have significant impact

## Document Constraints

- **Length**: 1 page maximum
- **Format**: Full narrative prose, no bullet points
- **Focus**: Essential information only
- **Audience**: Decision-makers who need quick understanding

## Required Sections

### 1. Headline

A clear, descriptive title that immediately communicates the topic. The headline should answer: "What is this about?"

### 2. Why (Context/Problem)

Explain why this topic matters:
- The problem or opportunity being addressed
- Why action is needed now
- Impact if no action is taken
- Relevant context for understanding

Keep this brief but compelling. The reader should understand the urgency and importance.

### 3. What (Solution/Proposal)

Describe what is being proposed:
- The recommended action or decision
- Key components of the proposal
- Expected outcomes
- How it addresses the problem

Be specific and concrete. Avoid vague recommendations.

### 4. How (Approach)

Explain the implementation approach:
- Key steps to execute
- Resources required
- Timeline overview
- Dependencies

Focus on the critical path, not every detail.

### 5. Next Steps

Provide clear, actionable recommendations:
- Specific actions needed
- Who is responsible
- Decision points required
- Immediate priorities

Decision-makers should understand exactly what they need to do after reading.

## Writing Guidelines

### Extreme Conciseness

Every word must earn its place:
- Remove redundant phrases
- Eliminate filler words
- Combine related ideas
- Use precise language

### Front-Load Important Information

Put the most critical information first:
- Lead with the recommendation
- Follow with key supporting points
- End with actionable next steps

Executives often read only the first few paragraphs. Ensure they get essential information immediately.

### Actionability

The 1-pager must drive action:
- Clear recommendation stated upfront
- Specific next steps defined
- Decision points identified
- Responsibilities assigned

### Data Density

Despite brevity, include key data:
- Most important metrics
- Critical evidence
- Essential benchmarks

Choose the 2-3 data points that most strongly support the recommendation.

## Example Structure

```
[HEADLINE: Clear Topic Description]

[WHY paragraph: Problem/opportunity and why it matters now,
with key data point establishing urgency]

[WHAT paragraph: The proposed solution or recommendation,
with expected outcome and how it addresses the problem]

[HOW paragraph: Implementation approach including key steps,
timeline, and resources needed]

[NEXT STEPS paragraph: Specific actions required, who owns them,
and immediate priorities for decision-makers]
```

## Relationship to 6-Pager

The 1-pager can serve as:
- **Standalone document**: For simple decisions
- **Executive summary**: Preceding a detailed 6-pager
- **Pre-read**: Before a longer discussion
- **Follow-up**: Summarizing decisions from a 6-pager meeting

When used with a 6-pager, the 1-pager should be self-sufficient while pointing to the longer document for details.
