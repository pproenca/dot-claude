# 6-Pager Memo Format

The 6-pager is Amazon's standard format for presenting complex ideas, strategies, or detailed analysis. It replaces PowerPoint presentations and enables data-driven decision-making.

## Document Constraints

- **Length**: Exactly 6 pages of narrative content
- **Appendix**: Unlimited additional pages for supporting materials
- **Format**: Full narrative prose, no bullet points
- **Font**: 11pt Times New Roman or Arial (standard readable fonts)
- **Reading time**: 20-25 minutes in meetings

## Required Sections

### 1. Introduction

Provide an outline of the idea being pitched or described:
- Precise statement of content and general direction
- Relevant details and contextual information
- Why this topic matters now

Keep this section succinct to avoid overloading the reader while containing all necessary context. The reader should understand within the first page why they should care.

### 2. Goals

List the metrics for success upfront so readers can evaluate the rest of the document through this lens.

Goals must be SMART:
- **Specific**: Clearly defined, not vague
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable metrics
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business priorities
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadlines

Example goals:
- "Increase customer retention from 72% to 85% by Q4 2024"
- "Reduce page load time from 3.2s to under 1s by June 2024"
- "Achieve $5M ARR within 18 months of launch"

### 3. Tenets

Guiding principles that inform decision-making for this initiative. Tenets are:
- Inspirational north stars
- Decision-making frameworks
- Trade-off guides when choices conflict

Tenets help readers understand the philosophy behind recommendations. They answer: "When we face difficult choices, what principles guide us?"

Example tenets:
- "Customer trust over short-term revenue"
- "Simplicity over feature completeness"
- "Data-driven decisions over intuition"

### 4. State of the Business

Provide a detailed snapshot of the current situation:
- How the team/product/initiative is structured
- How execution is progressing
- Performance against goals
- Key metrics and trends
- Competitive landscape

Include specific data, charts (in appendix), and trend analysis. This section establishes the factual foundation for later recommendations.

### 5. Lessons Learned

Provide context on what went well and what didn't:
- Successes with analysis of why they worked
- Failures with honest assessment of causes
- Surprising discoveries
- Changes in assumptions

Back up all analysis with relevant data and metrics. Lead with brutal honesty rather than polishing failures. Credibility comes from acknowledging what didn't work.

### 6. Strategic Priorities

Lay out the recommended path forward:
- Specific initiatives and their rationale
- Resource requirements
- Timeline and milestones
- Dependencies and risks
- Success criteria

Priorities should be precise without losing sight of the big picture. Each priority should connect back to the goals stated earlier.

### 7. Appendix (Unlimited)

Include all supporting materials:
- Detailed charts and graphs
- Data tables
- Technical specifications
- Customer research
- Financial models
- Competitive analysis

The appendix has no page limit. Reference appendix items from the main narrative (e.g., "See Appendix A for detailed financial projections").

## Writing Guidelines

### Self-Contained Document

The reader should understand the topic without needing other documents. Links to external documents should be sparse. All essential information belongs in the memo or appendix.

### Evidence-Based Claims

Every assertion requires supporting evidence:
- Market claims need data
- Customer insights need research
- Projections need models
- Comparisons need benchmarks

### Logical Flow

Each section builds on previous sections:
- Introduction frames the topic
- Goals establish success criteria
- Tenets explain decision philosophy
- State of Business shows current reality
- Lessons Learned provides historical context
- Strategic Priorities recommend the path forward

### Time Investment

Great 6-pagers take time:
- Initial draft: 1-2 days
- Revision and feedback: 2-3 days
- Final polish: 1-2 days
- Total: Often a week or more

Share drafts with colleagues for improvement. Set aside for a day, then edit with fresh perspective.

## Meeting Usage

In Amazon meetings:
1. First 20-25 minutes: Silent reading
2. Remaining time: Discussion and questions
3. Decision-makers engage with the document, not presenter personality

This format ensures decisions are based on the strength of ideas and evidence, not presentation skills.
