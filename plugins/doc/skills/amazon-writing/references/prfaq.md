# PRFAQ Format

The PRFAQ (Press Release / Frequently Asked Questions) is Amazon's "Working Backwards" document for product innovation. It starts with the customer experience and works backward to define what needs to be built.

## Document Structure

A PRFAQ consists of two parts:
1. **Press Release**: 1 to 1.5 pages describing the product announcement
2. **FAQ Section**: Unlimited length addressing anticipated questions

## Part 1: Press Release

The press release follows the standard Amazon PR format. See `references/press-release.md` for detailed guidance.

Key press release sections:
- Heading (product name)
- Sub-Heading (customer + benefit)
- Summary Paragraph
- Problem Paragraph
- Solution Paragraph(s)
- Spokesperson Quote
- Customer Quote
- How to Get Started
- Call to Action

The press release defines the destination: what success looks like from the customer's perspective.

## Part 2: FAQ Section

The FAQ section is the map to that destination, detailing the problems to solve and proposed solutions.

### External FAQs

Address questions that press and customers would ask:

**Product Understanding**
- How does it work?
- What problem does it solve?
- Who is it for?

**Practical Details**
- How much does it cost?

**Support and Service**

- How do I get help?
- What support is available?

**Comparison**
- How is this different from [competitor]?
- Why should I choose this over alternatives?
- What makes this unique?

Write External FAQs using customer language (no corporate jargon). The details provided matter because they demonstrate understanding of customer needs.

### Internal FAQs

Anticipate questions from senior leaders and stakeholders across the company:

**Finance Questions**
- What is the expected revenue?
- What are the cost projections?
- What is the payback period?
- How does this affect existing revenue streams?

**Technical Questions**
- What technical challenges need solving?
- What new capabilities are required?
- What are the infrastructure needs?
- How does this integrate with existing systems?

**Operations Questions**
- How will this be supported?
- What training is needed?
- How does this scale?
- What are the capacity requirements?

**Legal/Compliance Questions**
- What regulatory considerations exist?

- What contracts or agreements are needed?

**Marketing Questions**
- How will customers discover this?

- How does this affect brand positioning?
- What channels will be used?

**Risk Questions**
- What could go wrong?
- What are the dependencies?
- What happens if we're wrong about assumptions?
- What is the competitive response risk?

## FAQ Quality Standards

An excellent FAQ demonstrates:

### Mastery
Deep understanding of every aspect of the product, from customer experience to technical implementation to business model.

### Realism
Optimistic but honest assessment. Acknowledge challenges and risks. Avoid rose-colored glasses. Include conditions under which the product might fail.

### Data-Based Assessment
- Market size and potential with supporting data
- Competitive analysis with evidence
- Cost estimates with assumptions documented
- Timeline with dependencies identified

### Thoroughness
Address challenging problems that need solving, whether technical, financial, legal, or operational. Don't avoid hard questions.

## Writing Guidelines

### Living Document

A PRFAQ is continuously edited throughout the product development process. Version numbers around 100 are common at large companies. As understanding deepens, update the FAQ with new questions and refined answers.

### Question Selection

Include questions that:
- Stakeholders will actually ask
- Challenge assumptions
- Reveal risks and dependencies
- Demonstrate mastery of the domain

Don't include obvious or trivial questions just to fill space.

### Answer Depth

Provide substantive answers:
- Specific enough to be actionable
- Honest about unknowns
- Include data where available
- Acknowledge tradeoffs

### Stakeholder Capture

Use the FAQ to capture perspectives from different stakeholders. When someone raises a concern, add it as a question with the agreed answer. This:
- Ensures feedback is heard
- Creates shared commitment
- Preserves context for future reviews
- Increases ownership across teams

## PRFAQ Development Process

### Step 1: Draft Press Release

Start with the customer announcement. What would we say publicly? This forces customer-centric thinking from the beginning.

### Step 2: Initial FAQ

Add External FAQs based on customer research and intuition. Add Internal FAQs based on known organizational questions.

### Step 3: Review Cycles

Share with stakeholders. Each review generates new questions. Add them to the FAQ with answers.

### Step 4: Iteration

Refine both press release and FAQ based on:
- Customer research findings
- Technical feasibility assessments
- Business model refinements
- Stakeholder feedback

### Step 5: Decision Point

Use the refined PRFAQ to decide whether to proceed. A strong PRFAQ demonstrates the idea is well-understood and viable.
