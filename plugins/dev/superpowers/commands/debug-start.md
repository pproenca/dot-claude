description: Start systematic debugging for any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior
argument-hint: "[issue description] - e.g., 'test_user_login fails with 401', 'API returns wrong data'"

Use the systematic-debugging skill exactly as written.

Focus on:
1. The issue described in $ARGUMENTS
2. Following the four-phase framework (root cause investigation, pattern analysis, hypothesis testing, implementation)
3. NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
