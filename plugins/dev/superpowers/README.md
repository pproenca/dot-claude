Session initialization for optimal Claude Code configuration.

## Usage

The skills activate automatically based on context. For example:

- Ask "help me debug this" → systematic-debugging activates
- Ask "let's plan the implementation" → writing-plans activates
- Ask "run these agents in parallel" → dispatching-parallel-agents activates
