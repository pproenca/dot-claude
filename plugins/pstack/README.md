# pstack

> **this is a port.** pstack is [poteto](https://x.com/poteto)'s cursor plugin. this is the same skills, agents, and playbooks converted to run as a claude code plugin. the [upstream original](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) is the source of truth for the ideas; what changed here is listed under [what the port changed](#what-the-port-changed).

i'm [poteto](https://x.com/poteto). i'm not a president or ceo, but i've worked with millions of lines of code at Meta, Netflix, and Cursor. i'm also on the react core team where i help build and maintain react compiler.

there's a growing sense that ai writes too much slop code. i agree. i don't want to ship like a team of twenty slop artists. throughput without quality is not a goal i aspire to. if you want to go fast, go deep first. 

**pstack is my answer.** these are the same skills i use everyday to ship high quality code. this turns your agent into a real engineering team. the goal is not to maximize loc, in fact it's the opposite. pstack helps you write less, but higher quality code.

**pstack gives you fearless parallelism.** when you can go deep on one agent and trust it to write good, verifiable code, you can truly parallelize with confidence. start multiple agents up with `poteto-mode` and trust that they'll apply rigorous engineering principles to their work.

**models have different strengths.** many of these skills use multi-model workflows to take advantage of that. on claude code that means the four tiers, opus, fable, sonnet, and haiku, plus per-agent reasoning effort. [`/setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) maps every role to one.

fork it. improve it. make it yours. PRs are welcome! 

## install

```bash
# from a local checkout
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/pstack-cc
```

or drop the directory into a marketplace you already load. every skill lands under the `pstack` namespace, so they invoke as `/pstack:poteto-mode`, `/pstack:how`, and so on. if you also keep loose copies of these skills in `~/.claude/skills/`, delete them first, or you get two of each.

## get started

two steps:

1. run [`/setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) and choose which models you want.
2. use [`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) whenever you're doing anything that requires rigor.

new here? the [upstream pstack guide](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/docs/guide) walks you through a first real task. it is written for cursor, so read the [what the port changed](#what-the-port-changed) table alongside it.

that's it. the other skills are situational; the mode skill uses them for you as needed. out of the box the mode splits work by model strength: precisely-specified code and debugging go to `opus[high]`, fast mechanical code goes to `sonnet[high]`, prose and judgment go to `fable[max]`, and the hardest calls go to `opus[max]`. the default panel is all four. [`/setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) changes any of it.

## usage

use [`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task. it reads your request, picks from a set of playbooks, and runs the other skills as the steps need them.

### just use [`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md)

this skill is the main shortcut. i use it whenever i need the agent to do rigorous engineering work. it comes with twenty-two playbooks:

```
/poteto-mode this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even when idle. repro
first, then fix and verify.
```

```
/poteto-mode i'm going to bed. land the stack even if ci flakes. i want everything merged by
morning.
```

when invoked it:

1. opens a todo list. the first item is reading the inline principles index in the skill.
2. matches your task to a [playbook](./skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/) and copies the steps in verbatim.
3. routes to the other skills as the steps fire.
4. writes unslopped replies framed for the consumer and the maintainer.

the full rules and playbooks live in [`skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md).

[`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) is also a sticky mode: once entered it stays on across turns, applying itself when a playbook matches or the task needs rigor and staying out of the way otherwise. opt out any time by saying so. cursor enforced the stickiness with a `mode:` frontmatter flag; claude code has no equivalent, so the skill holds the mode itself via a re-check line at the top of `SKILL.md`.

[`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) works extremely well with claude code's `/loop` command. you can make it work for many hours without sacrificing rigor.

## skills

[`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) runs most of these for you when a step needs them (`how`, `why`, `architect`, `arena`, `swarm`, `interrogate`, `unslop`, `no-comments`, `technical-writing`, `tdd`, and the principles). the table below is for when you want one directly:

```
/how do we cancel runs? do we have an n+1 when we look up every run to cancel?
```

```
/interrogate review this pr.

### examples

mostly i type [`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task and let it route to a playbook. the other skills fire as the steps need them. a few i reach for directly.

## the `poteto-agent` and Comment Sicko subagents

pstack also ships a subagent that runs my style end to end. spawn it from a parent agent via [`subagent_type: "poteto-agent"`](./agents/poteto-agent.md). it reads `poteto-mode` in full, including its inline principles index, before doing any work. substituting `general-purpose` skips that read and drifts.

[`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) and [`subagent_type: "poteto-agent"`](./agents/poteto-agent.md) route through the same wrapper.

pstack also ships [Comment Sicko](./agents/comment-sicko.md), a read-only comment reviewer available as `subagent_type: "comment-sicko"`. usually invoke it through [`/no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md), not directly.

## principles

twenty-one short skills, one principle each. `poteto-mode` indexes them inline and reads that index at task start. the standalone files are there so other skills can reference a principle by name, and so the index can point at the full rule for each.

<details>
<summary>all twenty-one principles</summary>

| principle | group | rule |
|---|---|---|
| [laziness-protocol](./skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) | core | Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem. |
| [foundational-thinking](./skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) | core | Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious. |
| [redesign-from-first-principles](./skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) | core | Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on. |
| [subtract-before-you-add](./skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) | core | Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base. |
| [minimize-reader-load](./skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) | core | Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope. |
| [outcome-oriented-execution](./skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) | core | Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code. |
| [experience-first](./skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) | core | Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones. |
| [exhaust-the-design-space](./skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) | core | Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing. |
| [build-the-lever](./skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) | core | Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun. |
| [model-the-domain](./skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) | architecture | Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals. |
| [boundary-discipline](./skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions. |
| [type-system-discipline](./skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, refuse to lie to the compiler, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas. |
| [make-operations-idempotent](./skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) | architecture | Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs. |
| [migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis](./skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) | architecture | Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers. |
| [separate-before-serializing-shared-state](./skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) | architecture | Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant. |
| [prove-it-works](./skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'. |
| [fix-root-causes](./skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) | verification | Trace each symptom to its root cause and fix it there; reproduce first, ask why until you reach it, resist nil-check guards that silence crashes. |
| [sequence-verifiable-units](./skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer. |
| [guard-the-context-window](./skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) | delegation | Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads. |
| [never-block-on-the-human](./skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) | delegation | Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions. |
| [encode-lessons-in-structure](./skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) | meta | Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text. |

## not shipped here

a few things `poteto-mode` references but doesn't bundle:

upstream pstack leans on three cursor-only skills. this port swaps each for a claude code equivalent:

| upstream (cursor) | this port |
|---|---|
| `/deslop` from `cursor-team-kit` | `/simplify`, a claude code built-in |
| `control-ui`, `control-cli` from `cursor-team-kit` | a project-local `verify-*` skill (generate one with [`/create-verification-skill`](./skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md)), `/run`, or the `claude-in-chrome` skill |
| `/create-skill`, a cursor built-in | the [`skill-creator`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins) plugin from the official marketplace |

install `skill-creator` alongside pstack if you want skill authoring to work end to end.

## why are there no planning skills?

claude code already has a great plan mode which works great with pstack. but personally, i don't believe in planning. the best spec is code. if you do want to make a plan, [`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) covers it, but it's not a default.

## make it yours

`poteto-mode` is my style. you may not want exactly that.

type [`/automate-me`](./skills/automate-me/SKILL.md). it mines your recent transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/`, drafts a `<your-name>-mode` skill from how you've actually worked, and routes through pstack underneath. you keep pstack as the base and end up with your own routing skill alongside `poteto-mode`.

models are configurable too. type [`/setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md). it detects the models you can spawn and writes `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, mapping each role (code, judgment, the review panels) to a model and an optional reasoning effort. every skill reads it and falls back to sensible defaults when a line is absent, so you override only what you want. a repo can override the user file with `.claude/pstack.local.md`.

## what the port changed

everything below is the whole delta from upstream. the skills, agents, playbooks, and principles are otherwise unchanged.

| area | upstream (cursor) | this port (claude code) |
|---|---|---|
| manifest | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, explicit `skills`/`agents` paths | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, auto-discovery |
| sticky mode | `mode: true` + `reminder:` frontmatter | a re-check line the skill holds itself, top of `poteto-mode/SKILL.md` |
| skill frontmatter | `icon:`, `color:`, `reminder:`, `mode:` | dropped (unsupported) |
| agent names | `Comment Sicko` | `comment-sicko` (claude code requires kebab-case) |
| subagent tool | `Task`, `run_in_background: true` | `Agent`; subagents already run in the background, so nothing polls |
| read-only agents | `readonly: true` on the call | a posture stated in the prompt, or `subagent_type: "Explore"` for pure search |
| parallel writers | one worktree per agent, by hand | `isolation: "worktree"` |
| cloud agents | `environment: "cloud"` | `isolation: "remote"` where available, local worktree otherwise |
| models | `grok-4.6-fast-xhigh`, `gpt-5.6-sol-max`, `claude-fable-5-thinking-max`, `claude-opus-5-thinking-xhigh` | `sonnet[high]`, `opus[high]`, `fable[max]`, `opus[max]` |
| model config | `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc`, an always-applied rule | `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, read by each skill; `.claude/pstack.local.md` overrides per repo |
| reasoning effort | baked into the model slug | the optional `[effort]` suffix, applied by `Workflow` fan-outs; the `Agent` tool ignores it |
| transcripts | `~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/agent-transcripts/<uuid>/<uuid>.jsonl` | `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`, flat, slug keeps its leading separator |
| mcp discovery | cursor's available-tools map, the `mcps/` directory | the session tool list plus `ToolSearch` for deferred tools |
| user question | `AskQuestion` | `AskUserQuestion` |
| not carried over | the [docs guide](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/docs/guide) and the [benny automation pack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/automations/benny) | benny is built on cursor cloud automations; porting it means retargeting to claude code scheduled agents |
