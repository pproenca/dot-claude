description: Add session notes to CLAUDE.md for next time

Ask the user what they want to note about the current session.

Then:
1. Read CLAUDE.md
2. Find the "Recent Context" section under "Current Focus"
3. Add a timestamped entry with today's date and the user's note
4. Keep only the last 5 entries to avoid bloat

Format for entries:
```
### Recent Context
- **2025-11-30**: [user's note here]
- **2025-11-29**: [previous note]
```

This creates a simple "session memory" pattern for resuming work later.
